# Cell Colony Detector

[![demo](img/demo.png)](https://antielektron.github.io/cell_colony_detector/)

this is a simple python PWA webapp that uses opencv toâ€¦

1. cut out single wells from a cell culture plate's image [like this](./img/cell_input_demo.jpg) using [opencv's hough transform](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d4/d70/tutorial_hough_circle.html) methods
2. segment cell pixels (by a very simple threshold mechanism)
3. displays the segmented area for each detected well
